# Memory RTL Design and Verification

The plan is intended to test the functionality and performance of a memory array with 16 words, each having 32 bits.

The RAM RTL is designed using Verilog, and is tested by implementing class-based and UVM-based verification
environments in System-Verilog using constrained randomization approach. The functional coverage of the design is explored in a subscriber
class.
